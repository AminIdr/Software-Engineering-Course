# Exercise 3
## Question 1

#### Two functional requirements:
- The system is to calculate material costs and overhead costs incurred for each
manufacturing job.
- The system is to provide a “time spent” analysis (time to set up, time per step, rework time)
report of the work done by each craftsperson.
#### Two non-functional requirements:
- This must be possible on all shifts, including overtime. (Availability)
- The data for time and materials used is to be captured on touch screens next to the
machines on the factory floor so that the craftsperson’s work is not disrupted. This facility
is to be usable in a noisy and dirty workshop environment.
#### Two ambiguous requirements:

#### Two requirements in conflict with each other:
- The data for time and materials used is to be captured on touch screens next to the
machines on the factory floor **so that the craftsperson’s work is not disrupted**. This facility
is to be usable in a noisy and dirty workshop environment.
- The system is to provide a “time spent” analysis (time to set up, time per step, rework time)
report of the work done by each craftsperson.


The second requirement will disrupt the craftsperson's work as he would have to enter all that data through the touch screen.
